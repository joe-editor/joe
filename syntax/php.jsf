# 05/06/2022
# modified by ENL to match newest (PHP 8.1) language definition
#	+ standard types: array/int/bool/boolean/string/float/double/real
#	+ null/true/false constants
#	+ OOP keywords
#	+ all standard library functions
#

# TODO:
#  * heredoc support (as good as possible)
#  * highlight function and class names?
#	how to distinct between class member and standard library function names?

# Define colors
